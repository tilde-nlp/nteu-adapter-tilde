# Many Python libraries used for LT such as nltk, transformers, etc. default to
# downloading their models from the internet the first time they are accessed.
# This is a problem for container images, as every run is the "first time"
# starting from a clean copy of the image.  Therefore it is strongly
# recommended to pre-download any models that your code depends on during the
# build, so they are cached within the final image.  For example:
#
# RUN venv/bin/python -m nltk.downloader -d venv/share/nltk_data punkt
#
# RUN venv/bin/python -c "from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer" \
#                     -c "DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')"
